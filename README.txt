User Manager Command Line Interface(CLI)

Install
You can install the CLI on any system with Ruby and git.  If you do not have
either of these installed please contact your system administrator to have it
installed.  You can verify if you have Ruby by going to the command
line and executing the following command:  

ruby -v

You can verify if you have git installed by going to the command line
and executing the following command:

git -v

If you get any message from either of these commands that does not
give you a version number you do not have that utility installed.

To install the CLI go to your command line and execute the following
command:

1) Create a folder in the location of your choice to install the
utility into
2) Execute the following commands:
  git clone git@github.com:meadoch1/usermanagecli.git
  cd usermanagecli
  gem install usermanagecli-0.0.1.gem

Use
Once installed you can run the CLI by executing the command

usermanagecli

The built in help system will give you up to date information on the
options you can utilize.
